            <li>Cricket is played between two teams each made up of eleven players.</li>
            <li>Games comprise of at least one innings where each team will take turns in batting and fielding/bowling.</li>
            <li>The fielding team will have a bowler bowl the ball to the batsman who tries to hit the ball with their bat.</li>
            <li>The fielding team tries to get the batsmen out by…</li>
            <li> If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place then there will be no ball</li>
            <li>A “Wide Ball” will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery.</li>
            <li>A “Bye” is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.</li>
            <li>A “Leg Bye” is where runs are scored by hitting the batsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball or wide.</li>
            <li>If the ball is bowled and it hits the batsman first without the bat hitting it then an LBW decision is possible.</li>
